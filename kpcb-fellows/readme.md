#	Introduction

## Problem Description

See [Problem Description](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/z-estate-2018-stage/blob/master/kpcb-fellows/problem.md).

This is written by Zhiyang Ong to implement "a fixed-size hash map that
	associates string keys with arbitrary data object references" [KPCB staff 2017].

To optimize the data structure for algorithmic runtime and memory usage, do not
	copy the object [KPCB staff 2017]; instead, pass variables by reference.

###	Blurb of Problem Description

Design and implement a fixed-size hash map. 

## Design Decisions 

This document summarizes the design decisions of implementing a fixed-size
	hash map.

Design decisions:
+ *Python* and *Java* does not support implementations of fixed-sized linear
	containers (by default). 
	Hence, I am not going to implement a fixed-size hash map using *Python*
		or *Java*.
+ *GNU Octave* has poor support for object-oriented programming.
+ *C++* and *Java* support implementations of fixed-sized linear containers by
	default.
+ Select *C++* for memory-efficient implementation of the hash map, so that
	only references are passed/copied, rather than passing/copying the objects.
+ Implementation of hash map data structure.
	- Data type for the maximum capacity of the hash map is chosen to be
		"unsigned long long int", since it can store bigger values than the "int"
		data type.
		Hence, the data type for the number of items/pairs in the hash map
			would also be "unsigned long long int". 
	- Data type for the hash value (i.e., key) of the hash map is chosen to be a
		string, since it can support implementations of non-numerical hashing
		functions.
	- The default size of the fixed-size hash map is chosen to be 10, so that it
		is small enough to be tested exhaustively. 
	- Assume that this fixed-size hash map behaves as a set.
		When a user attempts to add duplicates into the hash map, this
			operation shall fail.
		That is, *set(key, value)* shall return false when duplicates of (key,value)
			pairs are added to the hash map.
		Also, *set(key, value)* shall return false when the *load factor* of the hash
			map is 1.

## Challenges

Determine if the templated hash map would require implementation of a hash
	function, or equivalent (e.g., a function object).

This repository is organized into the following directories (and subdirectories):
+ binaries.
	+ makefile.
		For build automation.
	+ doxygen.config.
		For customizing *Doxygen*-generated documentation.
	+ [Temporary files, from building the *C++* software]
+ src (source code).
	- elements.
		Class definition and implementation for a simple object, used to test
			the implementation of the fixed-size hash map.
	- hash_map.
		Definition and implementation for a fixed-size hash map.
	- test.
		Code used for unit testing, module testing, and integration testing.
	  	Also, the software testing process involves grey-box testing (for
	  		functional requirements/specifications).
	  	The software testing process is automated and executed before
	  		each software commit.
	 - utilities.
